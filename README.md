# Ryan-Fail Backend

The only purpose of this repository is to learn more about `Nestjs`, `MongoDB` and more by copying the website
[https://failbondi.fail/](https://failbondi.fail/) which display information about flybondi, a low cost airline from Argentina.

Based on their idea, we applied the same concept but for **Ryanair**, which is also a low-cost airline company.
